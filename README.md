Starting... 🚀
I have installed node dependecies by npm, to create backend.

**

Pre-requirements 📋
Created one folder with two folders, includes backend and frontend. In Front, created and installed React.js and axios put fetch. In backend folder, installed npm packages nodemon, morgan, body-parser, mongoose, express. All to use in the routes and request with DataBase

Created other folder to install reactjs and react-router-dom. In this part, I have created all componets and routers. I have created a folder called "img" where I save the images to use as a check, for "toggle".


Once I connected Atlas Mongo with ReactJs, It´s works perfectly, and the ToDoList is operational.
